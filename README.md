# Injector
a basic dll injector
# Usage
1. Download the source code and open it in Visual Studio
2. Build the solution in Release mode
3. Run the application
4. Type the name of the target process (e.g., notepad.exe) and press Enter
5. When the file explorer appears, select your DLL
6. The injector will find the process and inject the DLL
This injector has many issues as it was poorly written (made about 1.5 years ago)
